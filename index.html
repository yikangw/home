			<h1>The Three Different Classes</h1>
			<p><img src="classes2.png" width="400" height="113" alt="Overwatch Classes"/>
			<p class="large">DPS, Tank, Support</p>
			<!-- The three classes of Overwatch and their icons, respectively.. hard to align the class to its image :( -->
			<p class="spaced">Overwatch is a team game - with each team consisting of six players. Each hero can be separated into three different categories; DPS (Offense/Defense), Tank, and Support. DPS (Damage Per Second) heroes have low health and high damage output, Tank heroes can use barriers to defend their team and have high health/low damage, and Support heroes have low damage and health but heal your team&#8217;s health.</p> 
			<h2>Team Composition</h2>
			<p class="spaced">The standard team composition is two DPS heroes, two tanks, and two support heroes. (2-2-2) This is the composition used by the professional players at the highest skill level in the game. This composition has proved to be the most ideal throughout the two years of Overwatch&#8217;s existence.</p>
